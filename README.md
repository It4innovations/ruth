# FlowMapVideo

FlowMapVideo is a tool for visualizing the evolution of traffic flow over time. The output is a video with a map showing the traffic flow intensities at each time interval. The animation is generated using the [FlowMapFrame](flowmap/flowmapframe) library to render individual frames based on the output of the [Ruth](https://github.com/It4innovations/ruth) traffic simulator. It is designed for linux systems.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install `FFmpeg`:

    ```
    sudo apt install ffmpeg
    ```
2. Install [Ruth](https://github.com/It4innovations/ruth).

### Install

1. Activate the virtual environment where Ruth is installed

2. Install via pip
```
python3 -m pip install git+https://code.it4i.cz/mic0427/traffic-flow-map.git
```

## Run
```
traffic-flow-map --help
```

### Generate the animation
#### Traffic volume animation
Animation depicts the amount of the vehicles using both color and width of the routes.

use `generate-volume-animation`:
```
traffic-flow-map generate-volume-animation --help
```

#### Traffic speed animation
Animation uses colors to visualize current speed on the route. Volume of the traffic is depicted by the width of the routes.

use `generate-speeds-animation`:
```
traffic-flow-map generate-speeds-animation --help
```

#### Example
```
traffic-flow-map generate-speeds-animation <PATH_TO_DATA> --length 20 --title "Traffic flow" -c
```
* use `--title` to set your title
* use `-c` parameter to animate the movement of the vehicles

For fixed number of vehicles that will be depicted with maximum line width, use the `--max-width-density` parameter (important when making multiple videos to compare).


### Get more detailed information about the simulation
* use `get-info` to get simulation length
    #### Example
    ```
    traffic-flow-map get-info <PATH_TO_DATA>
    ```
* use `get-info --minute n` to get more detailed information about n<sup>th</sup> minute of the simulation
    #### Example 
    get info about 5<sup>th</sup> minute
    ```
    traffic-flow-map get-info <PATH_TO_DATA> --minute 5
    ```
* use `get-info --status-at-point` to get information about the simulation at given point of completion
    #### Example 
    get simulation status at point when 50% of vehicles reached their destination
    ```
    traffic-flow-map get-info <PATH_TO_DATA> --status-at-point 0.5
    ```
### Generate CSV file with simulation progress
* generate CSV file with data calculated for every n minutes of the simulation
* use `get_comparison_csv` to generate CSV file with simulation progress for 5 minute intervals
    #### Example 
    ```
    traffic-flow-map get_comparison_csv <PATH_TO_INPUT_DIR> --output-dir <PATH_TO_OUTPUT_CSV> --interval 5
    ```
* CSV columns contain:
    * time offset,
    * number of active vehicles in time interval & since start,
    * columns with number of vehicles with different alternative route algorithm,
    * columns with number of vehicles with different alternative route selection,
    * number of vehicles that finished journey in time interval & since start,
    * total meters driven in time interval & since start,
    * total driving time in time interval & since start,
    * number of segments visited in time interval & since start,
    * average speed in time interval & since start,
    * number of segments in different speed ranges in time interval & since start,
    * number of vehicles in different speed ranges in time interval & since start.
